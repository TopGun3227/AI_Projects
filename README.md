The biggest issue with today’s AI—despite all the hype—is that it can confidently give you the wrong answer. Ask a large language model a straightforward question about your data, whether it’s a PDF, an internal company document, or even today’s news, and it may respond with something that sounds convincing but is completely incorrect—or fail altogether. This behavior, known as hallucination, is the primary obstacle preventing AI from being genuinely reliable and useful.

Fortunately, the solution is simpler than it seems. We don’t need a larger or more powerful model. Instead, we need to let the model work with reference material—essentially giving it an open-book exam. This idea forms the foundation of a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
